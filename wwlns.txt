Brief interlude to another project, extracting features from Best Pictures Nominees for the oscars.

x, 1 	(taken 2)
r√£, 1 	(taken 1)
m, 1 	(taken 1)

	We should add a debugging flag to extract features so we can see where words came from, and build our own frequency counter.
X.	I think we can assume if the string starts with an l and is followed by [space, "'", consonant] it should be 		an uppercase I.

Features:
	contractions
	where/who/what words
